""" --- Collection Framework --- """
● The collection framework is an in-built facility provided by Sun
Microsystems.
● By using the Collection Framework, we can store different types
of values either of the same or different data types in a single
object.
● By using this we can perform operations like adding elements,
adding multiple elements at a certain index, replacing elements,
and removing elements like either a particular element or all the
elements at a time, we can perform searching and sorting
operations easily by using predefined methods and by
implementing fewer lines of code.
● It is one of the ways to store the data like a database.
● In Collections we do not have any primitive type of data, here we
will have data in the form of Objects and we only use wrapper
classes in this framework.
