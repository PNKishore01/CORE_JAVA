""" --- Queues --- """
It is a predefined Interface available in the “ UTIL ” package.
It will arrange the values in the form of first in first out of order (FIFO) .
Here we can add the elements at the end of the Queue remove the value from the
front of the queue.
It will use dynamic array like array list for storing the elements.
For these interfaces we have implementation class like linked list or array dequeue.
