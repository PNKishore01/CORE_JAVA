Map:: 

It is a pre defined Interface present in “ UTIL “ package.
It allows us to store the values in the form of both key value pairs.
Here we can’t add duplicate key but we can store duplicate values.
Here we can store null keys and null values.
It does not follow any order of elements, it internally follow hashing mechanism for
ordering the elements by default ascending order.
For this interface we have three implementation classes like Hashmap, Linked
Hashmap and TreeMap.
