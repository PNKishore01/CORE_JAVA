Interface:---------
* It is also a type of class, which contains variables, methods.
* Variables:- these are by default public static final variables.
* Methods:- these are by default public abstract methods.
* we can create Interface by using predefined keyword interface.
* methods have no implementation till 1.7
* variables and methods can be accessed anywhere because they are by default public
* memory allocation for variables should be only once at a time because they are static.
* by default methods are abstract so we don't want to mention abstract keyword.
* interfaces doesn't have constructors. by using interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.
* interfaces are 100% abstraction till 1.7
* from 1.8 onwards there were two methods are implemented 1.default, 2.static
* by using those we can create and write implementation for methods.
