Exception Handling:-

* In every java program we have to see two types of exceptions 1. Checked and 2. Unchecked
* The Exceptions which are raised during the compile-time is known as Checked Exceptions
* The Exceptions which are raised during the run-time is known as UnChecked Exceptions
* it is just a statement which causes abnormal termination for our java program and due to this remaining lines fo our 
java program will not get executed.
* Exceptions are classified into two types 1. Pre-defined and 2. User_defined
* 1. Pre-defined Exceptions are inbuilt exceptions those are developed by sun-micro systems.
* 2. user-defined exceptions are made by user, where our project requirement.
